## About Me

Hi! My name is Sri Keerthi Pitchapati. I am currently a junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
Apart from this class, I'm taking EE 242, EE 215, CEE 291, and Engr 321. In this class, I'm most excited to 
learn things that I feel will be incredibly applicable to anything that I will do in the future

Apart from school, I have an internship with a company called Slice. Slice is a pizza delivery place that focuses 
local pizzerias, and giving them a platform to sell pizza online. 

Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, skiing, and reading. I ski almost every weekend and I enjoy meeting people
with this shared interest. In addition, I go to the gym almost every day. I also read often and enjoy science fiction.
